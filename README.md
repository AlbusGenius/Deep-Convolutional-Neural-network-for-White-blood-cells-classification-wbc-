This project focuses on the classification of white blood cells (WBCs) using a deep learning approach. A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was designed, trained, and evaluated on a dataset of microscopic cell images. The goal was to accurately distinguish between different WBC types. The model achieves a strong validation accuracy of about 95%, consistently performing well across most classes. However, while the majority of cell types are classified reliably, the model demonstrates some difficulty in distinguishing Monocytes, which tend to be confused with other cell types, particularly Neutrophils.

To prepare the data, images were resized to 224 × 224 pixels and normalized using ImageNet statistics. For the training set, data augmentation techniques were applied, including random horizontal flips, random rotations of up to ±15 degrees, and slight variations in brightness and contrast. This was done to improve generalization and reduce overfitting. The test set, in contrast, was only resized and normalized, ensuring unbiased evaluation.

The CNN architecture consists of four convolutional blocks, each made up of two convolutional layers followed by batch normalization, ReLU activation, max-pooling, and dropout for regularization. The number of filters increases progressively from 64 in the first block to 512 in the fourth block, allowing the network to capture increasingly abstract and high-level features of the cell images. After feature extraction, the model applies an adaptive average pooling layer, followed by a fully connected classifier. The classifier includes dropout layers for additional regularization and maps the extracted features into the final five output classes corresponding to the WBC categories.

For training, the model used CrossEntropy loss with label smoothing (0.1) to reduce overconfidence in predictions. Optimization was handled by the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and weight decay of 0.01 to prevent overfitting. A StepLR scheduler was used to decay the learning rate by a factor of 0.1 every 10 epochs. The network was trained for 20 epochs with a batch size of 16. Training progress showed consistent decreases in both training and validation loss, and validation accuracy surpassed the target threshold of 90% within the first five epochs.

Evaluation of the model revealed strong performance overall. The training and validation curves show that the network converged smoothly without major signs of overfitting, with validation accuracy plateauing between 94–95%. Per-class analysis indicates that most WBC types—such as Neutrophils, Eosinophils, Lymphocytes, and Basophils—were predicted with high accuracy. However, Monocytes were less accurately predicted, often confused with visually similar classes, which slightly reduced their per-class performance. This issue highlights the intrinsic challenge of distinguishing subtle morphological differences among WBCs.

In conclusion, this CNN-based model demonstrates robust performance for white blood cell classification, achieving 95% accuracy and providing reliable results across most classes. Its weakness lies in distinguishing Monocytes, which suggests that future work could benefit from strategies such as adding more Monocyte samples to the dataset, using class-balancing techniques, or adopting transfer learning approaches with pre-trained architectures like ResNet. The final trained model is saved as improved_wbc_classifier.pth for reuse in downstream tasks or deployment.
